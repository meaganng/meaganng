### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Masters of Geomatics for Environmental Management candidate who is interested in how geospatial data can be used in planning, developing, managing, and evaluating. Currently, I am studying how canopy cover influences microclimate. Using LiDAR and Landsat-8 data, calculating canopy cover and land surface temperature can be used to run a multiple linear regression to understand predicted outcomes that come from the driving variable of canopy cover. My current experience with R and Python has helped me in efficiently running models and algorithms in GIS analyses.
